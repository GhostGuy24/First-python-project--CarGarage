# Car Management System

This is a simple car management system built in Python that allows users to perform operations such as displaying, adding, deleting, and finding cars from a file. The cars are stored in a list and serialized to a file (`myCars.txt`) for persistence. The program uses an Enum-based menu system for the user to interact with the application.

## Features
- **Display Cars**: View all cars stored in the system, with their brand, model, and color.
- **Add Cars**: Add a new car to the system, specifying the brand, model, and color.
- **Delete Cars**: Delete a car by its brand from the system.
- **Find Cars**: Search for a car by its brand and display its details.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Basic knowledge of Python (loops, conditionals, file operations)
- The `ast` module for reading data from a file.

## Setup
1. **Clone this repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/car-management.git
